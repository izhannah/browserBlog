# The Naloxone Dispenser 
In this project our mission was to create a DIY intervention that improve the lives of people living in that community. The objective of our DIY intervention is to help make Naloxone kits more accessible and more useful to people who are overdosing on Opiods. Therefore, we designed a Naloxone Dispenser in a 3D software called Blender. The Dispenser was built with a combination of 3D printing, nuts and bolts, and a broom stick handle. 

# My Angle 
Things I learned from this project was everyone has the potential to make something out of basic materials that can have a big impact in this world. Designer or not, there are so many social issues we people can contribute and help. There was one technical challenge my group and I faced when designing and making the project. The first technical challenge we faced was figuring out how we would design this Naloxone dispenser. We wanted to incorporate a self-dealing button but we figured out we wouldnâ€™t have the knowledge to build that. The design challenge we faced was deciding where to put the Naloxone Dispensers.
