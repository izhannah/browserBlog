# Laurier's Gmail Prototype 
In this project our mission was to create a better communication model for communicating with current students. Why?...Because majority of students claim that emails from Laurier are unorganized, cluttered and annoying. 

# My Angle 
Challenges my group and I faced was when 3 of our group members dropped out of the class halfway through our project. We solved that problem by having more group meetings, improving our wire-frames and prototype by constant feedback by our Professor and getting inspiration from a bicycle website called Trek Bicycle. I felt my group members and I still continued to work hard even after 3 of our members left, we did not did not give up. My group and I got an A on the project and I was really satisfied with everyone's contributions and efforts.
